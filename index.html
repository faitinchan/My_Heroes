			<h1>The Most Influential Figures in My Life</h1>
			<p>
				The following are the figures I look up to, including historical, fictional, mythical, and comtemporary characters. I've listed them in chronological order 
				according to their first appearance in my life. Each of them has significantly shaped who I am today and represents different stages of my journey to adulthood.

								<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus">Jesus</a></h2>
								<p>
									After attending kindergarten, my mother enrolled me in a Christian primary school, where the teachers were all Christians. Thanks to their 
									patience and support, they helped mold me from a restless, naughty kid who often disrupted the class into someone who could at least remain 
									seated. However, the more direct influence of Jesus Christ on me began when I was 11. A family member took me to a church to attend a small 
									gospel meeting. The narrative of heaven and hell led me to repent for my past wrongdoings. Since then, I dedicated a significant amount of 
									time and energy to understanding and following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible">the Bible</a> until about two years ago.

								<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a></h2>
								<p>
									The summer before I entered secondary school, I read a biography of Einstein. Unlike other biographies, his journey into discovering 
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity">the theory of relativity</a> fascinated me. The theory itself was captivating, 
									and his story inspired me to dream of becoming a theoretical physicist, setting me on a path in the STEM field. However, the romanticized 
									portrayal of him in the biography also led me to imitate the stereotypical "crazy scientist" image, focusing on intense, innovative thinking 
									at the expense of mundane daily life.

								<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Guo">Yang Guo</a></h2>
								<p>
									Yang Guo, courtesy name Gaizhi, is the fictional protagonist of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Yong">Jin Yong</a>'s wuxia novel, 
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_the_Condor_Heroes">The Return of the Condor Heroes</a>. After discovering my oficial IQ 
									test score, measured by a psychiatrist, I identified with Yang Guo due to the similarities in our intelligence and personality traits. I 
									deeply resonated with his challenges and internal conflicts, often drawing parallels with my own situation. This led to a typical "me 
									against the world" mentality, which presisted into my late adolescence.

								<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bakuman_characters#Moritaka_Mashiro">Moritaka Mashiro</a></h2>
								<p>
									During high school, I became obsessed with Japanese manga. Moritaka Mashiro, the main character in 
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsugumi_Ohba">Tsugumi Ohba</a> and 
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi_Obata">Takeshi Obata</a>'s manga series 
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakuman">Bakuman</a> (the same creators behind 
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note">Death Note</a>), inspired me. The story and the characters' dedication to their craft 
									captivated me, and I even bought drawing tools to create my own manga. I experimented with my style, drawing inspiration from 
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal&iacute;">Salvador Dal&iacute;</a> and 
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher">M.C. Escher</a>. However, my passion for manga came at a cost, and my academic 
									performance suffered, a trend that persisted until I graduated from university.

								<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem">Marshall Bruce Mathers III</a></h2>
								<p>
									I discovered Eminem's song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVkUvmDQ3HY&ab_channel=EminemVEVO">Without Me</a> through the moive 
									<a href="https://em.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_Squad_(2016_film)">Suicide Squad</a>. The satirical vibe resonated with me, particularly his 
									critique of societal norms, which aligned with my own frustrations with the church I was part of at the time. I delved deeper into his music 
									and the hip-hop genre, finding the rhymes Eminem, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nas">Nas</a>, and 
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur">Tupac</a> to be especially impactful. Their music became a source of solace during my 
									darkest times, motivating me to face challenges head-on. However, my admiration for them also led to some imitation, influencing my style, 
									speech, and behavior.

								<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson">Jordan B. Peterson</a></h2>
								<p>
									As I grew increasingly frustrated with the church, I sought alternative perspectives on the Bible and other religious texts. Discovering 
									Jordan Peterson's lecture series, 
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22J3VaeABQCn5nTAx65NRlh1EsKD0UQD">Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief</a> and 
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22J3VaeABQBlN8DUor7SKWCwSghcqlY5">Personality and Its Transformations</a>, I was struck by 
									the interconnectedness of religion, philosophy, science, and mathematics. These lectures facilitated a deeper self-exploration and 
									understanding, encouraging me to embark on a more challenging yet rewarding path.

								<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao">Tao</a></h2>
								<p>
									Over the years, as I've explored the people I look up to and tried to emulate their paths and philosophies, I've realized it's time to forge 
									my own path. No one can be a complete mentor to me except myself. I'm not the protagonist in anyone else's story, but I am in mine. To 
									navigate life, I need to pay attention to the natural order and the Tao of the world. Rather than forcing myself onto a path I think will 
									lead to success, I can adopt the philosophy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei">wuwei</a> from Taoism, following the natural 
									law and finding my own meaning in life.
